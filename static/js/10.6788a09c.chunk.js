Here's how it works. You can structure your atomic notes into 2 fundamental structures: Threads and Collections. Threads are ordered sequences of notes that represent 'lines of thought' and that define the causal relationships between notes. On the other hand, Collections are unordered sets of notes. Unlikely Threads, Collections cannot contain repeated notes. A note can belong to multiple Collections, and indeed Collections define the different groups a note belongs to. Every Thread or Collection must be contained, or wrapped, inside a note in a way that each note contains at most a Thread or a Collection. The Dashboard is made of 5 main components.",Object(i.jsxs)("ul",{children:[Object(i.jsx)("li",{children:"A Search Bar that allows you to search notes by matching the keywords that you input with the text of the preview of each note. In addition, the Search Bar gives you the option to apply the Thread (T) and Collection (C) filters, which only show you notes that contain a Thread or a Collection, respectively. You can also drop a note onto the Search Bar to only display notes that are contained in that note's Collection."}),Object(i.jsx)("li",{children:"A Search Area, that shows the results of your search. Notes here can be arbitrarily reordered and pinned at the beginning of the sequence."}),Object(i.jsx)("li",{children:"A Workspace, that contains the Thread or Collection you are currently working at. The Workspace can either be in Thread or Collection mode. Thread Mode means that whenever you WRAP the Workspace by dropping a note onto the Wrapper, the Workspace will be saved as a Thread inside the note you used to WRAP. In addition, the system will add a causal link between each consecutive note. On the other hand, whenever you WRAP a Workspace in Collection Mode, the Workspace will simply be saved as a Collection inside the note that you have chosen and no links will be created. You cannot wrap the Workspace within a note that is contained in it, or with a note that already has a Thread or a Collection. As a complementary functionality, whenever the Workspace is empty you can drop a note onto the Wrapper to expand the Thread or Collection that is contained into the note."}),Object(i.jsx)("li",{children:"A Links Area, that shows you all the links related to a note that your system has recorded so far.
